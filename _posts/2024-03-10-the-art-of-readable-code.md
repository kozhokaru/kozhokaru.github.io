excerpt: "Code is read far more often than it's written. Optimizing for readability is optimizing for the long term."
---

We spend 90% of our time reading code and 10% writing it. Yet we optimize for the 10%. This is a fundamental misallocation of effort that leads to technical debt, bugs, and frustrated developers.

## Code Is Communication

Code isn't just instructions for computersâ€”it's communication between developers across time. Your future self is a different developer. Your teammates are different developers. Write for them.

## The Hierarchy of Readability

1. **Correct**: Does it work?
2. **Clear**: Can someone understand it?
3. **Concise**: Is it as simple as possible?
4. **Consistent**: Does it follow patterns?

Notice that conciseness comes after clarity. Clever one-liners that sacrifice understanding for brevity miss the point entirely.

## Naming: The Foundation

Names are the most powerful tool for communication in code:

```javascript
// Unclear
function calc(x, y) {
  return x * 0.1 + y * 0.05;
}

// Clear
function calculateTotalTax(stateTax, federalTax) {
  const STATE_TAX_RATE = 0.1;
  const FEDERAL_TAX_RATE = 0.05;
  return stateTax * STATE_TAX_RATE + federalTax * FEDERAL_TAX_RATE;
}
```

Good names:
- Reveal intent
- Avoid ambiguity
- Use the problem domain language
- Are searchable
- Are pronounceable

## Functions: Single Responsibility

A function should do one thing, do it well, and do it only:

```javascript
// Does too much
async function processUserRegistration(userData) {
  // Validate
  if (!userData.email || !userData.password) {
    throw new Error('Invalid data');
  }
  
  // Hash password
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(userData.password, salt);
  
  // Save to database
  const user = await db.users.create({
    ...userData,
    password: hashedPassword
  });
  
  // Send email
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
  
  // Log event
  logger.info(`User registered: ${user.id}`);
  
  return user;
}

// Better: Separate concerns
async function validateUserData(userData) {
  if (!userData.email || !userData.password) {
    throw new ValidationError('Email and password required');
  }
}

async function hashPassword(password) {
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  return bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
}

async function createUser(userData) {
  validateUserData(userData);
  const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(userData.password);
  
  const user = await db.users.create({
    ...userData,
    password: hashedPassword
  });
  
  await notifyUserCreated(user);
  return user;
}

async function notifyUserCreated(user) {
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
  logger.info(`User registered: ${user.id}`);
}
```

Each function now has a clear, single purpose. Testing becomes trivial. Reuse becomes possible.

## Comments: Why, Not What

Comments should explain why, not what. The code itself should explain what:

```javascript
// Bad: Explains what
// Increment x by 1
x++;

// Bad: Redundant
// Check if user is admin
if (user.role === 'admin') {

// Good: Explains why
// We need to refresh the cache here because the user's 
// permissions might have changed during the session
refreshPermissionsCache(user.id);

// Good: Explains business logic
// Users get a 15% discount after their 5th purchase
// per Q3 2023 pricing strategy
const discount = purchases > 5 ? 0.15 : 0;
```

## Structure: Visual Hierarchy

Code should be scannable. Use whitespace and organization to create visual hierarchy:

```javascript
class ShoppingCart {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
    this.items = [];
    this.discount = 0;
  }

  // Core functionality
  addItem(product, quantity = 1) {
    const existingItem = this.findItem(product.id);
    
    if (existingItem) {
      existingItem.quantity += quantity;
    } else {
      this.items.push({ product, quantity });
    }
    
    this.recalculateTotals();
  }

  removeItem(productId) {
    this.items = this.items.filter(item => 
      item.product.id !== productId
    );
    this.recalculateTotals();
  }

  // Calculations
  calculateSubtotal() {
    return this.items.reduce((total, item) => 
      total + (item.product.price * item.quantity), 0
    );
  }

  calculateTotal() {
    const subtotal = this.calculateSubtotal();
    return subtotal * (1 - this.discount);
  }

  // Helper methods
  findItem(productId) {
    return this.items.find(item => 
      item.product.id === productId
    );
  }

  recalculateTotals() {
    // Trigger UI update
    this.notifyObservers();
  }
}
```

Related functionality is grouped. Public interface comes first. Implementation details come last.

## Error Handling: Fail Clearly

Errors should be informative and actionable:

```javascript
// Unhelpful
throw new Error('Invalid input');

// Helpful
throw new ValidationError({
  field: 'email',
  value: userData.email,
  message: 'Email must be a valid email address',
  suggestion: 'Did you mean @gmail.com instead of @gmial.com?'
});
```

## Consistency: The Invisible Foundation

Consistency reduces cognitive load. Pick conventions and stick to them:

- **Naming**: camelCase vs snake_case
- **Async**: Promises vs callbacks vs async/await
- **Errors**: Exceptions vs return values
- **Structure**: Functional vs OOP

The specific choice matters less than the consistency.

## Refactoring: Continuous Improvement

Readable code doesn't happen in the first draft. It's achieved through continuous refactoring:

1. **Make it work**: Solve the problem
2. **Make it right**: Refactor for clarity
3. **Make it fast**: Optimize if needed

Most code never needs step 3. Steps 1 and 2 are non-negotiable.

## The Test of Time

Readable code stands the test of time. It can be:
- Modified without fear
- Debugged without archaeology
- Extended without rewrites
- Transferred without documentation

## Conclusion

Writing readable code is an act of empathy. It's a gift to your future self and your teammates. It's the difference between code that merely works and code that works *with* you.

The next time you write code, ask yourself: "Will someone thank me or curse me when they read this six months from now?"

Choose to be thanked.
